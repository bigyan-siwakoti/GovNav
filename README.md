# GovNav Assistant

**GovNav Assistant** is a user-centric web application developed for GovHack 2025 to simplify how Australians access government services.

### The Problem

Navigating government services is often overwhelming, particularly during stressful life events like losing a job. We built the GovNav Assistant to fix this by reducing complexity and empowering citizens to engage with government services confidently.

### Our Solution

It's an AI-powered web app that uses a hybrid approach to provide help:
* **A Guided Navigator:** Provides step-by-step checklists for users who need guidance.
* **A Smart Chatbot:** Offers instant answers for users with specific questions.

Our goal is simple: to help Aussies get the support they need, without the stress.

### Tech Stack
* **Front-End:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
* **Framework:** Bootstrap 5
* **AI:** Simulated using JavaScript with a roadmap for a full Python backend.

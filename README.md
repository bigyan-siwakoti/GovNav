### ## The Problem

For many Australians, navigating government services can be a complex and stressful maze, especially during major life events like losing a job. This complexity can prevent citizens from accessing the vital support they need. Our project aims to solve this by providing a simple, intuitive, and intelligent front door to government services.

### ## Our Solution

The GovNav Assistant is a user-centric prototype that features a unique hybrid model to cater to different user needs:

* **Guided Navigator:** For users who are unsure where to start, our step-by-step checklists provide a clear, curated path with plain-English explanations and direct links to essential services.
* **Data-Powered AI Assistant:** For users with specific questions, our chatbot provides instant answers. It's powered by a Python backend that can query real government datasets to provide factual information, such as the locations of service centres.
